== Neo4j Server Extension for minimalistic Web-UI

This is an Demo for an Extension for http://neo4j.com/download[Neo4j Server] that not only provides and endpoint that provides graph data
but also exposes html, css, js and image files from a `resources/webapp` directory, contained in the jar.

This can be used for small, self-containted demos, visualizations or proof of concept style applications, but not for real applications that should use Neo4j Server as a database backend server.

=== The Demo: Popoto.js

As my demo I provide a setup that exposes http://popotojs.com[popoto.js] automatcially on top of the data you have in your graph.

The `StaticWebResource` provides the web-files of the visualization from the `resources/webapp` directory.
And `PopotoResource` adds a second endpoint to provide a `config/config.js` which uses label, property and index information to provide the necessary config for popoto's visualization.

*Note that you have to disable auth for this demo as I haven't added means for it to retrieve a username/password.*

You can use the demo by cloning and building (`mvn clean install`) this repository.
And then copy the resulting jar in the server's plugin directory.
And edit `neo4j-server.properties` to register the package name with an endpoint.

=== How does it work?

It is actually quite simple.
This is the core idea of exposing static web resources under the mountpoint.

@GET
@Path("{file:(?i).+\\.(png|jpg|jpeg|svg|gif|html?|js|css|txt)}")
public Response file(@PathParam("file") String file) throws IOException {
    InputStream fileStream = findFileStream(file);
    if (fileStream == null) return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).build();
    else return Response.ok(fileStream, mediaType(file)).build();
}

private InputStream findFileStream(String file) throws IOException {
    URL fileUrl = findFileUrl(file);
    System.out.println("Find file " + file + " url " + fileUrl);
    if (fileUrl==null) return null;
    return fileUrl.openStream();
}
